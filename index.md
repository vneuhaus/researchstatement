## Research Statement

I am fascinated by the question of how artificial neural networks work. I want to understand how a comparatively simple system is able to solve complex tasks by simply solving equations. Furthermore, I want to understand how such systems can be optimized and analyzed with tools that are normally used to solve and analyze physical systems. By this I want to get a better understanding of real networks and - if possible - connect those very different models.

My current attempt to gain a better understanding of these systems consists in the use of tools that are usually used by statistical physicist in information theory. With those tools one is able to get a better insight into the information inside the structural components of networks.
